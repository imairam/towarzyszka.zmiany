            I am a therapist, facilitator, and companion of change.<br /><br />
            I live in an intercultural relationship and work in diverse,
            multicultural settings. I have lived in <strong>Italy</strong> and
            <strong>Latvia</strong>, and I have studied and trained in
            <strong>Poland, Italy, the Czech Republic</strong>, and
            <strong>Germany.</strong> <br /><br />I’m endlessly curious about
            the world and the people around me. I love asking questions and
            searching for answers — especially while being close to nature. The
            forest feels like home to me, and water brings me peace.<br /><br />
            My guiding values are <strong>respect, freedom, love</strong>, and
            <strong>humility.</strong> I strive to live by them and to create
            spaces where people can meet themselves and each other with
            authenticity and care.<br /><br />
            I love cooking, walking barefoot, and singing.

          <h2 class="my_background">My Background</h2>
          <p class="mainText2">
            I hold a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Social Animation</strong> and
            a <strong>Master’s degree in Pedagogy</strong> with a specialization
            in <strong>Social Rehabilitation and Psychotherapy.</strong> I also
            completed postgraduate studies in
            <strong>Psychosomatics and Somatopsychology,</strong> and a
            two-level training in <strong>Solution-Focused Therapy.</strong
            ><br /><br />
            During my studies, I was part of the
            <strong>Sexology Research Circle,</strong>
            exploring questions of identity and diversity. My Bachelor’s thesis
            focused on stereotypes about lesbians, and my Master’s thesis
            examined how foreigners perceive the identity of Gdynia’s residents
            within the urban space. <br /><br />For a time, I considered an
            academic career, but life beyond the university called louder — and
            so I became a <strong>therapist and guide in transformation.</strong
            ><br /><br />Over the years, I have trained internationally in
            <strong
              >embodiment, mindfulness, and nature-based personal
              development.</strong
            >
            I completed a <strong>massage course,</strong> and have taken part
            in many workshops in areas such as
            <strong>motivational dialogue, anti-discrimination,</strong>
            and
            <strong>Dance Movement Therapy.</strong>

            <p class="mainText3">
              I am a <strong>woman of the circle,</strong> and a student of
              <strong>Tanna Jakubowicz-Mount</strong> and
              <strong>Mona Cichoń</strong>. For two years, I took part in the
              process “Guides on the Path // My Medicine” led by Tanna, during
              which I went through my initiation and received the name
              <strong>Flora Flow – the one who touches with her heart.</strong>
              <br /><br />Since then, I’ve been walking the path of my own
              medicine — learning how to guide myself and how to support others,
              especially women, in discovering their inner power and gifts. For
              the past four years, I’ve been leading a
              <strong>women’s development circle.</strong> <br /><br />For many
              years, I was part of the
              <strong>Educational Cha(lle)nge Association,</strong> where we
              worked to bring more awareness and empathy into education through
              workshops, trainings, and conferences. <br /><br />Today, I
              collaborate with: <br /><strong
                >– Pomorskie Center for Psychotherapy and
                Psychoeducation</strong
              >
              <br /><strong>– Alterway Child Development Studio</strong>
              <br /><strong>– Youth Cooperation Center</strong> <br /><strong
                >– Emigration Museum in Gdynia</strong
              >
              <br /><br />In the past, I’ve also worked with
              <strong>TEB Education, Dovista, LPP, Arla, Lifeworks,</strong> and
              <strong>Citi.</strong> <br /><br />My path has been diverse — I’ve
              worked as a
              <strong
                >nanny, art teacher, educator, project coordinator,</strong
              >
              and <strong>trainer.</strong> <br />I’ve led closeness workshops
              in Riga, facilitated identity sessions, danced
              <strong>Contact Improvisation,</strong> and even taught
              <strong>djembe drumming</strong> and <strong>archery.</strong>
              <br /><br />All these experiences have shaped how I see the world
              — through many perspectives, always with compassion and curiosity.
